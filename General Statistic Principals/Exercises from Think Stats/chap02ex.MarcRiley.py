# Given a list of values, there are several ways to count the frequency of each value.

t = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]


# You can use a Python dictionary:

# In[5]:


hist = {}
for x in t:
    hist[x] = hist.get(x, 0) + 1
    
hist


# You can use a `Counter` (which is a dictionary with additional methods):

# In[6]:


from collections import Counter
counter = Counter(t)
counter


# Or you can use the `Hist` object provided by `thinkstats2`:

# In[7]:


import thinkstats2
hist = thinkstats2.Hist([1, 2, 2, 3, 5])
hist


# `Hist` provides `Freq`, which looks up the frequency of a value.

# In[8]:


hist.Freq(2)


# You can also use the bracket operator, which does the same thing.

# In[9]:


hist[2]


# If the value does not appear, it has frequency 0.

# In[10]:


hist[4]


# The `Values` method returns the values:

# In[11]:


hist.Values()


# So you can iterate the values and their frequencies like this:

# In[12]:


for val in sorted(hist.Values()):
    print(val, hist[val])


# Or you can use the `Items` method:

# In[13]:


for val, freq in hist.Items():
     print(val, freq)


# `thinkplot` is a wrapper for `matplotlib` that provides functions that work with the objects in `thinkstats2`.
# 
# For example `Hist` plots the values and their frequencies as a bar graph.
# 
# `Config` takes parameters that label the x and y axes, among other things.

#2-1 answer: using the information found on page 21 the frequency at which the majority of first babies are born are within 2-3 weeks of 28.6 weeks. Meaning first babies arrive as normal.
